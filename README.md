LabVIEW FPGA Framework for Implementing Cryptomining Algorithms

# Current Status
  * Full implementation of CryptoNight Step 3 in LabVIEW Host (not in the FPGA)
  * Full implementation of a single round of CryptoNight Step 3 in LabVIEW FPGA
    * See (https://github.com/JohnStratoudakis/CryptoCurrencies/blob/master/Monero/lv-monero/CryptoNight/FPGA/Fpga-Aes-Single-Round.vi)

# Up Next
  * Research CryptoNote
   * See https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/7923/what-exactly-has-been-changed-in-pow-algorithms-in-the-v7-fork
  * Clean up and refactore existing code
