# CryptoCurrencies
LabVIEW FPGA Framework for Implementing Cryptomining Algorithms

# Current Status
  * Full implementation of CryptoNight Step 3 in LabVIEW Host (not in the FPGA)
  * Full implementation of a single round of CryptoNight Step 3 in LabVIEW FPGA
    * See (https://github.com/JohnStratoudakis/CryptoCurrencies/blob/master/Monero/lv-monero/CryptoNight/FPGA/Fpga-Aes-Single-Round.vi)

# Up Next
  * Research CryptoNot
  * Clean up and refactoring of code

# HELP ME!
Okay, so I am taking a look at this project again and I see that there is now something called "CryptoNote", which is effectively "CryptoNight V7"

I have been searching for the whitepaper or specification, can anybody point me to it?
